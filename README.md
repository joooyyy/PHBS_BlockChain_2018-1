# Blockchain solution for agricultural products traceability system
## Introduction
On the one hand, there are a series of problems in China's agriculture, such as lack of resources, declining fertility, low degree of mechanization and low degree of informatization, which restrict the development of agriculture and the income of the rural population. On the other hand, food safety problems occur frequently in China, endangering the health of the Chinese people. Food traceability based on Internet of Things technology can not only solve the food safety problem, but also effectively improve the income of the agricultural population. If the food traceability system is managed by a centralized platform, the data can be modified unilaterally by the central platform. The "trust" of the information is still unresolved. The source traced back may be a forged source. However, Blockchain technology's characteristics of de-centralization, non-tampering and full-web publishing can perfectly solve these problems. This paper analyzes the problems existing in China's agriculture and food safety, puts forward the idea of solving the problems through the agricultural product traceability system, briefly discusses the successful case of "Chain Orange" relying on blockchain, and designs a traceability system model and traceability strategy based on blockchain. At the end of the article, according to the actual situation, it is proposed that the blockchain traceability system can be promoted through BaaS to ensure the technical level and save the promotion cost.

## I. Current Situation of Agricultural Development in China
* i. Current situation of resource utilization. In China's agricultural development, the available agricultural resources are relatively high, but the per capita arable land and freshwater resources are relatively small. China has only 2100 cubic meters of fresh water per capita, accounting for 28% of the world average. China uses groundwater exploitation to meet the demand for fresh water and irrigation, but excessive exploitation leads to the decline of the ground level and the cutoff of the surrounding lake waves, thus further causing the shortage of water resources. China has a rural population of 560 million, accounting for 40% of the country's population. China's total cultivated land area is only over 120 million hectares and the per capita cultivated land area is only 0.09 hectares, less than 50% of the world's per capita cultivated land area, which is difficult to meet the demand for intensive agricultural production.

* ii. Soil fertility status. In the history, people used farmyard manure and plant ash to ensure soil fertility in agricultural production. However, with the development of science and technology, a large amount of chemical fertilizer is now used to increase land yield. The use of a large amount of chemical fertilizer is gradually eroding soil fertility and causing serious damage to soil.
* iii. Current situation of agricultural income. In the development of Chinese society, the government is inclined to focus on the development of industry and urbanization in the formulation of food prices. The state has promoted the development of industrialization and urbanization through a series of policies, but has harmed the income of agricultural production. Although the government has issued a series of policies to promote the development of agriculture, it has not fundamentally changed this situation. In recent years, the proportion of agricultural income is gradually declining, and most farmers choose to go out to work to earn income. In 2018, China's rural per capita disposable income was only 14,617 yuan, while the urban per capita disposable income was 39,251 yuan, leaving a clear gap between urban and rural areas.

* iv. Current situation of agricultural production mechanization. In agricultural production, the use of mechanized equipment can improve agricultural production efficiency. China has initially realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in the production of crops such as rice and wheat. However, compared with countries with developed agriculture, China's level of mechanization is still in its infancy, and due to the restrictions of China's policies, agricultural distribution and development, China's mechanized production is difficult to achieve effective progress, thus affecting the development of China's agriculture.
* v. Current situation of agricultural informatization. With the continuous development of agricultural information technology, China's agricultural information construction has gradually taken shape and the basic conditions for its development have been continuously improved. However, there are still problems such as lack of application software and slow update of basic equipment. These problems are more obvious in the central and western regions of China, the utilization rate of agricultural Internet technology is relatively low, and some remote areas still have phenomena such as old computer equipment and underdeveloped networks. The imperfect basic equipment of agricultural information technology has seriously affected the distribution channels and mutual dissemination of agricultural information. The quality level of staff engaged in information service is quite different, and there is a lack of professional, scientific and experienced staff who have mastered agricultural information technology, which has had a great impact on the development of agricultural information, and problems encountered cannot be solved in a timely manner.

## II. Food Safety Issues and Causes
In China, food safety problems have appeared frequently in the past few years: in order to eliminate insect pests, some people use high toxicity and even highly toxic pesticide in large quantities, resulting in serious over-standard pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits; In order to increase production, some people blindly use banned hormones. In order to increase the lean meat percentage of pigs, some people even mixed "lean meat essence" into the feed. In order to whiten flour and vermicelli, some people dare to mix the toxic chemical "Rongalite".  The food safety problem is worrying. Major food safety incidents continue to occur, once again sounding the alarm bell of food safety issues.

![](https://github.com/liandi123/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/problem.png)

Food safety is the most basic livelihood issue. Why do food safety problems emerge one after another in China? I think there are mainly the following reasons:

* i. Agricultural production is decentralized and safe production technology is difficult to popularize. In recent years, although China has vigorously advocated intensive scale management nationwide and formulated a series of policy dividends to speed up land circulation, for the time being, the decentralized small-scale farmers' production mode still dominates, which has brought great obstacles to the quality and safety management of agricultural products in China. On the other hand, China's agricultural product quality and safety technology foundation is relatively weak, and farmers' scientific and cultural level is generally not high, so the mastery of pollution-free agricultural product production technology is relatively lacking.
* ii. Chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other residual pollution is serious. In China's agricultural development for many years, in order to quickly obtain the benefits of agricultural production, both agricultural enterprises and individual farmers have invested a large amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in farmland inside. Even some illegal businesses and farmers have used a large amount of aphrodisiacs and hormones and applied chemicals indiscriminately in order to strive for the early market of fruits and vegetables, resulting in the deterioration of the quality of agricultural products, resulting in poor taste and safety of fruits, vegetables and meat. Some have also used chemicals that have been banned by the state. Agricultural products with these chemicals remaining pose a serious threat to the health of many consumers.
* iii. Secondary pollution of agricultural products derived from agricultural pollution. According to the "China Land and Resources Bulletin 2015", by the end of 2015, the pollution level of cultivated land in China had exceeded the standard by 19.4%, which has caused great obstacles to the quality and safety of agricultural products. Agricultural products will be contaminated by a large amount of pesticides, lead, arsenic and other harmful substances and cause acute poisoning, which will then reach consumers through the sales chain. At this time, a small amount of chemical pollution will enter the human body through food for a long time and cause chronic health hazards, such as heavy metals lead, mercury, cadmium and fluorine in coal. These pollutants may accumulate in the human body for a long time and cause various chronic hazards to human health, some of which are even difficult to cure.
* iv. Emphasis on quantity rather than quality. Farmers attach more importance to the quantity of agricultural products than to their quality. In addition, what I said before was scattered production and management, lack of knowledge on safe production and processing, production technology and other aspects, and no one to give professional guidance to them, resulting in a messy product variety, which is difficult to ensure its specifications, standards and quality safety. For some enterprises, due to the high cost of developing high-quality agricultural products in some economic systems, they began to ignore social benefits and unilaterally pursue economic benefits, adding harmful chemicals to food.

## III. Blockchain Solves Agricultural Products Safety Problem
Through the establishment of food traceability system, food safety problems can be solved, and rural development problems can also be solved:

* i. Give consumers protection and the right to know, let consumers trace back the source of food, production process and transportation process through this food, and let consumers know whether what they eat is safe.
* ii. It can greatly enhance the reputation of the enterprise and reduce the risk of production management. Once problems occur, it can be recalled quickly and the root of the problem can be found.
* iii. Record all kinds of information of the products so that the food can be actively pursued. In this way, no matter which link goes wrong, it can be quickly traced, thus allowing food operators to self-discipline and strictly implement various laws and regulations on food, thus ensuring food safety.
* iv. Make the food source traceable, the destination verifiable, and the responsibility investigated, so that enterprises and consumers are at ease.
* v. The improvement of the quality of agricultural products provides support for the price increase of agricultural products, which can improve the income of farmers. On the other hand, the establishment of the system also provides part-time jobs for farmers. To solve the problem of uneven development between urban and rural areas.

According to the data of China Industrial Information Network, the market size of food traceability system in 2018 is 1752 million yuan, and it is expected to reach 3500 million yuan in 2020, with broad market prospects.

![](https://github.com/liandi123/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/marketsize.png)

If the food traceability system is built by the government, the government's management pattern will lead to the problem of anticlimax. The early stage of the construction is huge and cannot be effectively promoted after the construction, and there is also a lack of continuous operation services and management.If the food traceability system is to be built by enterprises in a unified way, it will involve the problem that it cannot be effectively popularized, and there is also the problem of "trust" when the food traceability system is directly built by enterprises. For example, other peers cannot fully trust the platform.Moreover, the biggest problem of the centralized platform is that the data can be modified unilaterally and afterwards by the central platform. The "trust" of the information is still unresolved. The source traced back may be a forged source.

However, Blockchain technology's de-centralization can perfectly solve these problems:

* i. blockchain's distributed database determines that all participants will have complete data records, and unilateral information modification will no longer be possible. This puts all participants in the same position. Everyone is the contributor and owner of information. There is no need to worry about the monopoly of information.
* ii. The whole network release of information results in data that cannot be modified once generated, i.e. can be verified with each other at any time. As a result, once the data of agricultural products from production, processing to sales are generated, they are real records and cannot be forged. Since then, the data forger no longer exists. Agricultural personnel no longer have to worry about the "Bad money drives out good" problem.
* iii. If agricultural products are added to the traceability system based on blockchain from planting, production, processing and sales, it will have a qualitative impact on the operation mode of the entire agricultural industry chain.

Blockchain assists agricultural development from five aspects of traceability, records, credit, efficiency and safety:

* Traceability: One of the most important problems of agricultural products is the source of the products and where the products come from. Records will be kept on the line from the production farm to the farmer's warehouse, to the distribution center, and then to the consumers. All you need to do is scan the two-dimensional code on the package to know all the information and ensure that the product is really fresh and safe.
* Record: This is to ensure that the transaction record is true and will not be tampered with. In the past, businesses used to brush up on orders, give false favorable comments, and media reports made untrue comments, thus misleading consumers. These have caused serious troubles to consumers. Now, with the introduction of Blockchain technology, consumers can comment only after purchasing goods. This ensures that people who comment have used the products and the comments are true and effective.
* Credit: Credit is mainly to solve the problem of effective execution of both parties' transactions. Through Blockchain technology, record the performance of the participants in the transaction in the past. In this transaction, both parties use Blockchain technology to make records, and the contract will be automatically executed after expiration. Any default by either party will be recorded by the blockchain system, which will affect the future credit. In agriculture, it is mainly applied to the sale of agricultural products. In the past, many people ordered products and cancelled the reservation unilaterally when it expired, which seriously harmed the interests of farmers. When it was introduced into Blockchain technology, it was systematically recorded when it was scheduled and automatically executed when it expired, thus effectively protecting the interests of farmers.
* Efficient: The application of Blockchain technology can realize the integration of agricultural logistics, capital flow and information flow. Reduce agricultural costs and promote the efficient operation of the agricultural industry chain.
* Security: Online shopping now often involves personal information security leaks and other incidents, causing serious troubles to the parties. Through cryptography algorithm technology, Blockchain technology ensures that the information of platform participants is not leaked, thus ensuring the security of transactions.

The value of blockchain-based farm traceability system is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

* i. Link up the key business data of the whole process to make the information open and transparent.Blockchain technology is applied to all links from the selection of planting varieties to the final delivery to consumers. The major links include the production, processing, transportation, storage and sales of agricultural products. Each link has many subdivisions. The data generated from each process will be recorded in blockchain's account book data. Smart contract's internal logic will realize the correlation between each process data and finally generate a unique agricultural product ID card. Internet of Things data is directly linked to provide real first-hand data.
* ii. Link up and link down to ensure the quality under the condition of true information.The farm traceability system involves Internet of Things equipment collection standards, operation electronic forms, planting standards, and risk point thresholds, including detail fields and key nodes. These processes and standards standardize the grain production process under the chain, improve the quality of output in each step, including the quality of agricultural products under the chain, and also ensure the quality of agricultural product data on the chain.
* iii.  mass data storage optimization to ensure stable operation of the system. The traceability system for agricultural products can manage tens of thousands of mu of land. The Internet of Things equipment deployed in inside collects different types of data in real time. The data generated during different farming hours will also be linked in real time, resulting in massive data, which will be stored in the data warehouse of the large farm platform.
* iv. Smart contract Let Planting Production Process Cycle Benign. Blockchain has integrated all kinds of data of production and sales that cannot be tampered with. Based on these data, Smart contract can feed back the sales results to the planting link.The excellent quality of agricultural products can bring better benefits to the farmers who grow these grains, play a positive role in improving grain cultivation, and can also provide data support in agricultural loans and so on, thus promoting a virtuous cycle of grain cultivation.
* v. consensus mechanism ensures data consistency and is not tampered with. The consensus mechanism implemented by the Blockchain technology at the bottom of the agricultural product traceability system includes many steps such as transaction endorsement, transaction sequencing, transaction verification and bookkeeping, and each step needs to sign and verify the request. Only a plurality of endorsement nodes endorse the transaction results, meet the endorsement strategy, and reach a consensus among the sorting service nodes. The blocks generated by sorting can be recorded in the book after being verified and passed by the accounting node. Any error in any step will lead to transaction failure. After these steps, the books recorded in each accounting node are consistent. The traceability system of agricultural products is based on PKI system to verify the user's identity and to verify the digital signature of the submitted request, so as to ensure the safety and tamper-resistance of the data, make the data more transparent and greatly improve the trust of consumers.

## IV. "Chain Orange" Case
The navel orange family in southern Jiangxi is known as the king of the best quality vitamin C orange because of its large and seedless, elegant color, crisp and tender meat, moderate sweet and sour. It is also awarded the title of "high quality agricultural products" and "high quality fruit" by the Ministry of Agriculture. It enjoys a high reputation in the market and sells abroad. Authoritative statistics show that in 2016, Ganzhou's fruit industry planted an area of 2.48 million mu with a yield of 1.43 million tons, of which navel orange planted an area of 1.55 million mu with a yield of only 1.08 million tons. Because the market demand of navel orange in southern Jiangxi is far greater than the supply, the natural Shanzhai version of "navel orange in southern Jiangxi" was born.

![](https://github.com/liandi123/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/orange.png)

Or because the inferior currency drives out the reverse elimination of the good currency, the real navel orange in southern Jiangxi is gradually impacted by a large number of Shanzhai editions, falling into the situation of high quality, low price, or even unable to sell. According to the preliminary estimation of experts in the industry, more than half of the navel oranges sold in the national market every year are counterfeit Gannan navel orange brand or brand name. The phenomenon of counterfeit, inferior and inferior is more serious, which has a serious impact on the brand reputation of Gannan navel orange and the healthy development of the industry.

The application of blockchain technology in the anti-counterfeiting of navel orange in southern Jiangxi is equivalent to recording the information of every link of orange's source (i.e. orchard of origin), picking, storage, processing and marketing into "blocks", which are added to the "chain". Participants (i.e. consumers, businessmen and fruit growers) can see clear and transparent records from this "chain" to confirm orange. "Chain Orange" is a unique anti-counterfeiting label affixed to navel orange in southern Jiangxi Province by using the characteristics of blockchain wisdom and data authenticity. Each "chain orange" has its own unique "identity card", which makes every link of navel orange from the field to the dining table traceable instantly. Whether consumers, businessmen or fruit growers, they can confirm every detail in the circulation of "chain orange" by scanning code, and then determine the authenticity of navel orange in southern Jiangxi. It also ensures the safety of orange consumers.

At 10 a.m. on November 20, 2017, 25 tons of "chain orange" with its own "ID card" were snapped up in half an hour just after the launch of my online shopping platform under the flag of COFCO.

## V. Design of traceability system model based on blockchain.
I design a simple traceability system model and traceability strategy based on blockchain. According to the needs of agricultural production and circulation business processes, the traceability system will be designed from the implementation aspect. The goal of the designed system is to give full play to the characteristics of Blockchain technology. Then in the process of designing the agricultural product traceability system based on Blockchain technology, in order to achieve the research objectives, the following principles need to be followed:

* i. In the upstream and downstream of the agricultural product supply chain, the scale and size of participants are not the same. Some participants occupy a dominant position in the supply chain, but in order to form a good data entry and cooperation status. In the process of designing the system, the rights of participants in each link in the system should be balanced according to their actual needs and the overall layout of the system.
* ii. The interests of the participants in the upstream and downstream of the agricultural product supply chain are consistent, that is, the successful sale of agricultural products can realize its value, which is beneficial to all participants. In order to break this state of consistent interests, it is necessary to introduce new participants who play a role in supervision and management. The significance of the presence of participants lies in breaking the original situation of consistent interests and forming a situation in which participants restrict each other.
* iii. The starting point of the platform design is to meet the actual needs of users. In order to improve the ease of use of the platform, the platform design needs to be simple enough, and its functions and logic should be clear at a glance.
* iv. Blockchain technology is still in the stage of development and perfection. The designed system should be able to provide an embedding point for the integration of the following more perfect Blockchain technology. At the same time, the designed scheme can be pluggable, which will enable the later Blockchain technology to smoothly connect with the tracing system.

The scheme structure of the agricultural product traceability platform based on blockchain is shown in the figure. The data are stored in two ways: database and blockchain. The database is maintained by the consumer rights protection organization in the traceability system, and blockchain is jointly maintained by six parties: farms, processing plants, logistics companies, sales units, consumer rights protection organizations and regulatory authorities. In addition to farms, processing plants, logistics companies and sales units, system users also include: consumers and regulatory authorities. (Farms Includes agricultural production cooperatives consisting of farmers in a village, to avoid redundancy, use farms in the following part) 

![](https://github.com/liandi123/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/solution.png)

The main processes are:

* i. The farm packs the key information collected in the production process and simultaneously enters it into the database maintained by the consumer rights protection organization and the blockchain node maintained by the farm. The farm node obtains the message digest from the production information through SHA3 algorithm, sends the digest to blockchain through the blockchain node maintained by itself, writes the message digest into the block through the equal consensus process, and writes the successful information to obtain a return value, namely the hash value of a transaction in blockchain, which is the index to retrieve the data in blockchain, and stores the return value into the database. Similarly, the processing plant, the logistics company and the sales unit respectively input the information collected in the slaughter process, the logistics process and the sales sub-packaging process into the database, use SHA256 algorithm to retrieve the data, send it to blockchain through the blockchain node maintained by them alone, record it in blockchain, and store the return value into the database. In this process, consumer rights protection organizations and supervision departments supervise the behaviors of farms, processing plants, logistics companies and sales units. The monitoring method is to participate in the maintenance of the blockchain system, carry out the consensus process with the four nodes, and synchronize the blockchain data to the local nodes. Blockchain's bifurcation behavior is not recognized in the system. Once data is written into blockchain, it cannot be changed through bifurcation.
* ii. For consumers, the corresponding detailed process information is found out from the database maintained by the consumer rights protection organization through the serial number of the food. If the integrity of the information is to be checked, the message digest stored in the blockchain is compared with the digest obtained by the same SHA3 algorithm from the information queried in the database. If the two are the same, the data has not been changed after being entered into the system, and the data is complete. If consumers find that the retrospective data of the purchased food has been modified, they can file a complaint application with the consumer rights protection organization of the regulatory authority. After confirming that the complaint is correct, the consumer rights protection organization will store the complaint information in the database, and its message summary will be stored in blockchain to become the accountability credentials.
* iii. For unexpected errors in the data entry stage, farms, processing plants, logistics companies and sales units can send data correction requests to the regulatory authorities, which will review the data correction requests. If the data correction requests are reasonable, they will be approved and stored in the database in the form of a memo message. Then the information will be summarized and sent to blockchain through the blockchain node maintained by the regulatory authorities. Through the above-mentioned data storage mechanism, it can be ensured that the data cannot be tampered once stored in the system, thus realizing the data's non-tampering. At the same time, due to the introduction of consumer rights protection organizations and regulatory agencies, the centrality of core enterprises in the original traceability system was eliminated by taking advantage of blockchain's equality consensus, multi-point data backup and distributed characteristics. Under this mechanism, the data can not be tampered with and the system can be decentralized.
Traceability System Implementation Strategy. The implementation of traceability system needs to be carried out according to certain strategies to ensure the overall effect of implementation. For each participant in food production and processing, they can be added to the traceability system, and the use of the traceability system requires the regulatory authorities to carry out qualification certification, so as to issue the account number logged into the traceability system.
* i. Consumers. No information such as any account number of the traceability system is required, and all the information of the corresponding food traceability process can be found only by scanning the food number on the traceability platform after the food is purchased.
* ii. Regulatory authorities. On-the-spot investigation of food production and processing units that want to join the traceability system, mainly examining the hygiene conditions, business licenses and recording the basic information of the production units, such as geographical location, ownership, etc. In this system, there are farms, processing plants, logistics companies and sales units.
* iii. Farms, processing plants, logistics companies and sales units. Regulatory authorities need to reach the designated level of health status and operation status to appraise their health status and operation status so as to grant eligibility to join the system, and to register their geographical location, ownership information and Internet of Things acquisition equipment truthfully. After completing the work of information collection, the supervisory department enters the traceability system to input the corresponding information, and registers the operator account with the functions of input and query of original information, input and query of production information, input and query of output status, and information release of each link. They can only access the system through the operator's account and record information. If the sensor is deployed, the information recorded by the sensor is checked and verified by the personnel and recorded into the system. 

## VI. Blockchain traceability system through BaaS
Where to deploy blockchain is a problem to be solved. Blockchain requires professional design, computing and storage resources. According to the present situation of Chinese agriculture mentioned before, I think deploying systems on cloud platforms via BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) is a better choice. I will give a brief introduction of BaaS.

![](https://github.com/liandi123/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/baas.png)

BaaS is a service platform that helps users to create, manage and maintain blockchain networks and applications. It has the characteristics of reducing development and use costs, taking into account rapid deployment, convenience and ease of use, high safety and reliability, and is applied to blockchain.

BaaS is a service platform to help users create, manage and maintain blockchain networks and applications. It has the characteristics of reducing the cost of development and use, taking into account rapid deployment, easy to use, high security and reliability. It is a platform to provide blockchain service capabilities for blockchain application developers. BaaS converts computing resources, communication resources, storage resources, and the upper blockchain accounting ability, blockchain application development ability, blockchain supporting facilities ability into programmable interfaces, which makes the application development process and application deployment process simple and efficient. At the same time, through standardized capacity building, it ensures the security and reliability of blockchain application and the operation of blockchain business. It provides support to solve operational problems such as flexibility, security and performance, so that developers can focus on development.

BaaS is an important service form to accelerate blockchain's landing in various industries, especially its deep integration with the real economy. At present, the most popular mode of BaaS is blockchain Cloud Service, which is also called blockchain Cloud Service in a narrow sense. IaaS takes computing resources as services, PaaS takes software development platforms as services, and SaaS takes software as a service. As a cloud service, BaaS is a cloud rental platform for blockchain facilities. Its multi-tenant feature allows computing resources, platform resources and software resources to be shared to the greatest extent. BaaS provides node lease, chain lease and tool lease capabilities. Tools include development tools, deployment tools, monitoring tools, etc. Through large-capacity resource pools, BaaS ensures that tenants' business scale can be flexible, leased facilities can be shared and exclusive, and can operate safely and reliably. In addition, BaaS also provides necessary technical support services. The specific capabilities of BaaS include the ability to build blockchain nodes and the whole chain, the ability to develop applications in blockchain, the ability to deploy applications in blocks, and the ability to monitor operations in blockchain. Blockchain Service is committed to providing an enterprise-level blockchain basic technology platform. Based on the service-oriented basic design principle, the design should take ease of use, maturity and scalability, safety and reliability, visual operation and maintenance as the main directions, and cooperate with partners to build a safe, efficient, reliable and flexible enterprise-level blockchain solution and application for users quickly and at low cost. 

Easy to Use: It is not easy to deploy an enterprise-class distributed blockchain system based on open source components. It requires not only professional knowledge of blockchain, but also various complex designs and configurations, and is extremely prone to errors. Blockchain service needs to help enterprises to realize automatic configuration and deployment of blockchain applications, and provide all Life cycle management in blockchain, so that customers can easily use blockchain system and focus on innovation and development of upper-level applications. 

Flexible expansion: blockchain service design should adopt abstract architecture and pluggable modules, and face interface design software. It should design and implement network construction, encryption, consensus, resource management, user management, operation and maintenance management and other functional modules separately. It can also package the underlying technologies of blockchain such as network construction and consensus and implement them as a plug-in. The system shall provide seamless expansion of computing resources, storage resources and network resources. Blockchain service can also follow the principles of being based on open source, superior to open source and giving back to open source, actively invest in and lead the open source community, and provide users with mature and advanced blockchain systems. 

Security and reliability: blockchain service should have effective tamper-proof mechanism, clear crash fault-tolerant security boundary, secure data management and isolation mechanism, support core technologies such as consensus algorithm, homomorphic encryption, zero knowledge proof, telecom-class cloud security, high-speed network connection, mass storage, etc., and provide perfect users, secret keys, rights management, isolation processing, reliable network security foundation capability, classified and classified failure recovery capability and operation security. 

Visual operation and maintenance: blockchain service shall provide fault classification and classification alarm system and operation and maintenance method, provide necessary operation and maintenance interface and operation and maintenance authorization capability, provide all-weather visual resource monitoring capability for chain codes and chain applications, and provide perfect user management system for power division and domain division based on authority. 

Cloud chain combination: blockchain has the characteristics of multi-participation, multi-center, traceability and tamper resistance. Only when it is combined with specific enterprise applications and industry scenes can it really produce value. Combining the cloud platform to provide all kinds of infinitely expandable resources needed by blockchain, rich and diverse cloud computing products and customized industry solutions, the combination of cloud chains can bring greater convenience, value and imagination to enterprises. 

Cooperation and Opening-up: blockchain Service focuses on building the underlying technologies and platform service capabilities, and works with partners in various industries to jointly build a credible industrial blockchain solution and blockchain ecology, jointly promote the landing of blockchain scenarios, and help customers achieve commercial success.

## VII. Conclusion
Food traceability based on Internet of Things technology can not only solve the food safety problem, but also effectively improve the income of the agricultural population. If the food traceability system is managed by a centralized platform, the data can be modified unilaterally by the central platform. The "trust" of the information is still unresolved. The source traced back may be a forged source. However, Blockchain technology's characteristics of de-centralization, non-tampering and full-web publishing can perfectly solve these problems. This paper analyzes the problems existing in China's agriculture and food safety, puts forward the idea of solving the problems through the agricultural product traceability system, briefly discusses the successful case of "Chain Orange" relying on blockchain, and designs a traceability system model and traceability strategy based on blockchain. At the end of the article, according to the actual situation, it is proposed that the blockchain traceability system can be promoted through BaaS to ensure the technical level and save the promotion cost.

By writing this paper, I have a deeper understanding of the blockchain, and have confidence in the broad application scenario of the blockchain in the future. I am very lucky to be able to take this course. I hope that in the future blockchain can bring more contributions to mankind.
